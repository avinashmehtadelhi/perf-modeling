b'# Performance Modeling SIG \n\nThe RISC-V Performance Modelling (and Simulation) SIG drives the strategy and coordinates the development of a common performance modelling and cycle-accurate simulation framework for the RISC-V ecosystem\xe2\x80\x94together with related topics, such as trace file formats and data-sharing between tools and members.\n\nPerformance modelling for RISC-V, as covered by this group, addresses two critical stages of the design lifecycle:\n\n* the prediction of performance for microarchitectural implementation choices, and\n* the workload-analysis and evaluation of compilation strategies for specific micro-architectures.\n\nThese performance modelling and simulation tools serve as the foundation for predicting the impact of workloads, micro-architectural changes, and compiler improvements.  Side-by-side with functional simulation (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cfast-model\xe2\x80\x9d implemented in QEmu) and the reference model (i.e., SAIL), this covers the entire lifecycle of RISC-V development.\n\nThe Performance Modelling SIG covers the following activities:\n\n* Provides gap-analysis, strategy-development and outreach for Performance Modelling and Simulation topics for the Software HC.\n* Coordinates the selection and joint development for the Performance Modelling and Simulation tools across the RISC-V membership and ecosystem to reduce duplication of effort and foster the collaboration on development activities\n* Establishes common interchange formats for trace files and a common repository for trace files of representative workloads\n* Drives the outreach to external (Open-Source, Academic, and Commercial) projects addressing Performance Modelling for RISC-V and actively recruits partners to support RISC-V in their Performance Modelling tools\n* Works with membership to establish open-access performance models for low-end (in-order) and high-end (out-of-order) microarchitectures to foster experimentation with RISC-V in performance modelling\n'
